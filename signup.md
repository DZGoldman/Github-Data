### 1) Sign Up
  - Name
  - Email

### 2) Upload resume/Online Presence
  - User Uploads resume
  - Github handle
    - Scraped via email. User confirms that handle is correct, has option to change it.


### 3) Tell Us About Yourself
  - Role
    - Auto-select designer/developer based on User's skills
  - Years working
    - Give estimate based on timeline of git-commits and experience on resume
  - Top skills/ Other skills
    - Weighed by github
  - Education
    - Scrape from resume
  - Location
    - Scrape from resume/github


### Other info Gathered/Saved for Approval Process
-  Git hub skills (to compare with user's claimed skills)
- Timeline on github (from first commit to most recent, commit frequency?)
- Number of github repos
- Github ranking
- If user rejects predicted github handle, can add cross-reference verification between email address and github profile
### Additional Considerations
- Say their claims are contradicted by github - what then? Send them some additional questions
- Finding github info by email requires search feature, and this much lower API limit.
